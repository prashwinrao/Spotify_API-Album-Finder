# Spotify_API-Album-Finder
Spotify Album Finder is a web application that allows users to search for albums by artist name using the Spotify API. The application displays the album cover, album name, and a link to the album on Spotify. Built with React, this project demonstrates the use of hooks, API calls, and state management in a modern JavaScript application.
